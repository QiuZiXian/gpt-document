## 1 闯关任务	

Python实现wordcount	

```python
import re


def wordcount(text):
    # 使用正则表达式替换标点符号为空格
    text = re.sub(r'[.,;!?]', ' ', text)
    
    # 将文本分割成单词列表并转换为小写
    words = text.lower().split()
    
    # 创建一个字典来存储单词计数
    word_counts = {}
    
    # 遍历单词列表，更新字典中的计数
    for word in words:
        if word in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] += 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] = 1
    
    return word_counts

# 示例用法
text = """
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday,
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there
might be other options that are bigger for the
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected,
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it
to her.
"""
print(wordcount(text))

```
